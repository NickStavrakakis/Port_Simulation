# Port Simulation

## _Academic Year of 2018-2019_

This project is about the creation of independent programs that can run simultaneously and simulate the operation of a commercial port. This system is supported by the implementations of 3 types of processes where each has a different role.
The three types of process are:
  1) vessels that want to bind and stay for some finite time/space in the port
  2) port master
  3) port operation monitor
  
The above types of processes are independent programs that can run simultaneously and to implement cooperatively what is happening in a port.
